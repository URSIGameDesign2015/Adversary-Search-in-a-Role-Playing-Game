- Create a non-player character that follows the player character?
       -- make the sidekick a child (in unity terms) of the player
- Work on camera angle
- Raycasting to detect the player
- Putting posters on the wall?
     -- how to put a new texture on the wall
     -- spawn a new object on the wall where the player points?
     -- find pre-existing posters so we know the politics that the player has
     -- how does this affect the evolution of the game? community? police? media?
