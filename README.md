# Adversary-Search-in-a-Role-Playing-Game
Designers of role-playing games face a dilemma: The game can guide the player through a sequence of quests, challenges or levels resulting in a coherent story line, but leaving the player little freedom of action. Alternatively, the game can allow the player to act freely in a wide open world, but resulting in no coherent story line. In previous work, we developed a method of using adversary search (the “Min-Max algorithm”) to reconcile these conflicting objectives. In our summer work, we will apply this approach to develop a role-playing game called “Hands Up”. The player assumes the role of a young person of color in an urban setting beset with problems of unemployment, crime, drugs and police brutality. The player attempts to negotiate the challenges of daily life (school, family, friends, recreation) keeping out of trouble and preserving his/her own dignity in a racially charged setting. We will implement Hands Up using Maya to model the environment and characters, and using Unity to implement the game mechanics, in C# or JavaScript. The student intern will be involved in designing, implementing and testing the game, and evaluating the effectiveness of adversary search as game control framework.
